# Stress Levels in Canada

This project investigates the relationship between social factors, stress levels, and mental health across Canada. Using data from a complex national survey, it focuses on a selected set of features and applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and data visualization. The main goal is to provide an overall picture of stress determinants and explore how stress may influence mental health. This work can serve as a foundation for more in-depth or targeted analyses.
